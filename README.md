## Instalation
To use this library in your project you will need to get the jar from [here](https://github.com/doug-rocha/ncept-game-engine/releases), and all the depencies listed below (if you intend to use the default MapLoaders and Sound related classes), after that, put all jars as dependencies into your project and you're free to go.
